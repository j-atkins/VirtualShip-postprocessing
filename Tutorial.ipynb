    "## Analysing CTD Transect Data\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, you have previously conducted an sea-going expedition along a transect in the North West Shelf region, collecting CTD data at various stations from the Norwegian Sea down to the coast of the Netherlands:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"snapshot1.png\" alt=\"CTD Transect\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will analyse the collected CTD data to visualise and interpret the vertical profiles of different oceanographic parameters along the transect. Please follow the steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the `CTD_transects.ipynb` notebook in JupyterLab (you can find this on the left sidebar in the file explorer). Your group's data from last week's expedition has been uploaded to this cloud instance for you to use with the notebook. Work through the notebook cells (by pressing the play button at the top of the notebook for each one or using Shift + Enter).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When you finish running the notebook you will see plots representing the vertical profiles of the various variables across the the transect (remember, you have to set the variable you want to view yourself!). Analyse these plots and answer the reflect on the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **General Observations**: Explain why the data is available at different depths throughout the expedition. (HINT: have a look at this [view](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/viewer/expert?view=viewer&crs=epsg%3A4326&t=1763208000000&z=0&center=2.2383852806576665%2C54.68362679433201&zoom=12.885623504987896&layers=H4sIAEQtF2kAAxXNuw6CMBQA0H_5M2hBBsOGxAcJESMuxJib2l4oSaGEdgAJ.66uZznPBYxTNKbGjNJCvKweaD7TmEmI4ZwXhyTH5JrkVZmVp_J_TJPygbdLhYwFyMJoKzrqLHZGYqMNDmpG3tcC2Ybtd5IatI67VmDIwjAIfJ8m5.tv7tS8lTQ4ZcCDT9ZLmiAOmAft.0Ud.VibphRcE8Q115bW1xf_UqbErQAAAA--&basemap=dark) of the European North West Shelf. What's it showing?)\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Temperature**: Are there any notable temperature variations across depth and along transect? Are there temperatures that stand out? For example, temperatures below 0 degrees?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Salinity**: Describe how salinity changes along the transect, particularly near coastal areas. Why would salinity change closer to land?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Oxygen**: Describe the oxygen evolution across the transect. Can you identify any oxygen minimum zones? Any crossing of particular thresholds, e.g., hypoxia?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Nitrate**: Observe the nitrate concentrations, especially near land. Explain why higher nitrate levels are found in these regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **pH**: Analyse the pH variations along the transect. Hypothesize reasons for lower pH values in certain areas and explore any correlations with temperature or other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Phytoplankton (Chlorophyll)**: Locate areas with high chlorophyll concentrations. Discuss any correlations with temperature or other environmental factors."
